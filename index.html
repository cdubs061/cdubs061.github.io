                I became interested in software development when a friend from
                high school wrote software that helped us with homework. This
                experience inspired me to sign up for a high school class being
                offered by an organization called Operation Spark. It taught us
                how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is when I developed
                my passion for programming. After I graduated from high school I
                immediately knew that I wanted to major in computer science. I
                chose to minor in robotics to expand future opportunities into
                more hands-on fields if needed. My dream would be to work for a
                company that is a household name and contributes to a better
                future.

                    During my internship at Hyosung I was able to work on the
                    UI/UX of ATMs. We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was put
                    on their most high profile project where I helped fix visual
                    bugs and design issues. I adhered to corporate guidelines,
                    while also demonstrating my ability to blend aesthetic
                    design with functional user experience.

                    During my time working under Professor Bhattacharya at LSU,
                    I made a website that communicates with multiple third-party
                    APIs. This experience taught me the ability to work with
                    documentation and gain an understanding of authentication
                    methods. The purpose of this project was to use the APIs to
                    pull data collected from sensors collecting environmental
                    data that would be graphed in real time. I made both the
                    client and server side logic for the web application.
