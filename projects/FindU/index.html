                    The purpose of this app is to help college students browse
                    and find colleges that they may want to go to. The browsing
                    method is a Tinder style swiping where you swipe right on
                    colleges you like and left on colleges you do not like. This
                    was an app that we took into startup for a short period of
                    time. There was only one other app like it on the market
                    called "Niche" but I think that this simple swipe design
                    makes our app better because it has a simpler interface.

                    The project was done in Dart Flutter and Firebase. The app
                    contains lots of tough programing features like preloading
                    data and a swiping with your finger animation.

                    In the Future I would like to add better account creation
                    and support features as well as monetization features. The
                    monetization features would look like data that we could
                    sell to colleges.
