              My game is a bullet hell like game where you use an 
              Arduino joystick to move around as an electric guitar 
              and the Arduino LED displays your health. The goal is 
              to survive as long as you can and you need to hit enemies 
              with certain projectiles to kill them to make it easier to survive.

              The reason you play as a guitar is because originally it was 
              supposed to have guitar hero based mechanics to the game as well. 
              The guitar shoots out music note projectiles as a way to fight its enemies. 
              The enemies need to be hit with the right color note based off the 
              letters that are written on each enemy.

            <h2>Future Development</h2>

            <p>
              My future development would include the guitar hero mechanics. 
              The mechanics would work by automatically hitting an enemy 
              with a music note every time a note is successfully played. 
              You would need to play every note perfectly in order to keep up 
              with the enemies and every mistake you make would pile on top of 
              each other until you cannot keep up with the amount of enemies.
